## **Challenges Faced**

During the development of this project, I faced a few challenges:

1. **Understanding Responsive Design**: Initially, I had difficulty understanding the concept of responsive design and how to implement it using CSS3. To overcome this, I referred to various online resources and tutorials which helped me understand the concepts better. I also practiced by creating small projects which helped me gain hands-on experience.

2. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring that the website looked and functioned consistently across different browsers was another challenge. I used tools like CanIUse and BrowserStack for testing the website on different browsers and made necessary adjustments in the code to ensure compatibility.

3. **Layout Issues**: While designing the layout of the website, I faced issues with alignment and spacing. I overcame this challenge by learning and implementing CSS Flexbox and Grid, which made the task of creating complex layouts easier.
